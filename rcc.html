        <h1>Randomized Counterfactual Credit (RCC)</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">A Step Towards Information Infrastructure · 31 December 2025</div>

        <p>
            Prediction markets fail as information infrastructure. For information to get where it's needed, we need ways to pay people for sharing what they know. This post introduces Randomized Counterfactual Credit (RCC), a way to measure how much a piece of information actually helped predict what happened. RCC is a step towards infrastructure that actually pays people to share what they see.
        </p>

        <div class="figure">
            <img src="figure1.svg" alt="RCC mechanism diagram showing claims being randomly gated to parallel belief systems">
        </div>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            Prediction markets have proven we can aggregate beliefs into a single, accurate probability. The price <em>is</em> the world's aggregated belief.
        </p>

        <p>
            But the price is also the product. And the product is visible to everyone the moment it exists. Prediction markets produce public goods, so they mostly only work for gambling and entertainment.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p>
            PnL is a bad way to pay for information.
        </p>

        <p>
            You need capital. You need risk tolerance. And even if you have enough conviction to play, you are limited by whether anyone's on the other side of the trade.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aggregation is solved, but sourcing is not.
        </p>

        <p>
            A nurse notices a spike in respiratory cases. A construction worker notices a new large project. A commuter sees a pothole the city doesn't know about.
        </p>

        <p>
            These people have valuable information, but prediction markets ask them to <em>gamble</em>. Even in the rare event there is a liquid market for them to bet in, many won't take the risk. The information never enters the system.
        </p>

        <p>
            Information infrastructure should look like: You see something important, and you report it. If this information was useful and mattered, you get paid. No stake, no gambling. Just tell the world what you see.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next question is then: "How do you know if something mattered?"
        </p>

        <p>
            If we remove trading and prices entirely, we still need a way to know whether information helped. Randomized Counterfactual Credit is our attempt at this.
        </p>

        <h2>Randomized Counterfactual Credit (RCC)</h2>

        <p>
            RCC is credit attribution without trading. Sourcers submit claims, and parallel belief systems evaluate them. When the event resolves, we measure which claims improved accuracy at the moment they arrived.
        </p>

        <p>
            Liston's <em>Cognitive Finance</em> (<a href="https://x.com/no__________end/status/2003642285863354520" target="_blank">link</a>) proposes a "wall" between information sourcers and market traders. This wall separates the 'seeing' from the 'betting.' We agree with the wall, but for the case study, we get rid of the market entirely, instead showcasing the behavior of a single LLM participant that sets the estimated probability.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>

        <p class="indent">
            We want to know how important a specific claim was to the accuracy of the market. We can approximate this by asking: what would the world have believed without this claim?
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            In RCC, we run N parallel belief systems. Each one sees the same question and uses the same update logic. When a claim arrives, we flip a coin for each system, so some systems see it and others don't.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            Beliefs evolve in parallel. For each claim, we then compare: at the moment it arrived, did systems that saw this claim predict better than systems that didn't?
        </p>

        <h3>The Math</h3>

        <p class="indent">
            At each step, each replica holds a probability between 0 and 1.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            When the event resolves, we can score each replica's belief at any point in time using Brier score:
        </p>

        <div class="formula">
            Brier(p, outcome) = (p − outcome)²
        </div>

        <p class="indent">
            Where p is the replica's probability at that moment, and outcome is 1 (YES) or 0 (NO).
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            For each claim k, we compute:
        </p>

        <div class="formula">
            RCC(claim_k) = mean_brier_at_k(didn't see k) − mean_brier_at_k(saw k)
        </div>
        
        <p class="indent">
            This compares prediction accuracy at the moment claim k arrived, between replicas that saw it and replicas that didn't.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            Positive RCC means the claim helped. Negative means it hurt. Zero means noise.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            Payouts are simple: take all positive RCC scores, normalize them, and then divide the bounty across all claims.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">
            In our simple case study, negative RCC gets nothing. You don't lose money for being wrong, you just don't get paid.
        </p>

        <div class="figure">
            <img src="figure2.svg" alt="RCC scores by claim for Tesla Robotaxi market">
        </div>

        <h2>Experiment</h2>

        <p>
            We ran a simulated market scenario: "Will Tesla begin commercial Robotaxi service (paid rides, no safety driver) in any US city by June 30, 2026?"
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a multi-billion dollar question. Any real signal could move TSLA's stock considerably. Institutions are looking for ground truth, while regular people (drivers, city employees, Tesla owners) will see things first.
        </p>

        <p>
            We ran 25 parallel belief systems, each with a 50% chance of seeing any given claim. We generated 18 example claims, and submitted them in order to simulate real-time information flow. All 18 claims are in the Appendix.
        </p>

        <p>
            When a claim comes in, we flip a coin for each belief system replica to decide if it sees the claim. After each claim, every system updates its probability estimate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Claims are evaluated relative to what the system already knew. They are not just scored by whether they were right, but whether they helped at the time.
        </p>

        <p>
            After submitting all 18 claims to the system, we resolved the market as YES for this experiment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our highest scoring claim was a Reddit post: photos of 12 white Model 3s with no visible driver operating near the Gigafactory. Our lowest scoring claim was the California DMV disengagement data showing Tesla's FSD had 4.2 disengagements per 1,000 miles vs. Waymo's 0.08. This matches the thesis that distributed observers beat institutional sources. Random photos on Reddit provided more predictive value than Morgan Stanley's analysis. Interestingly, the 'Local opposition' claim, which was framed as bearish, actually scored highly because it revealed Tesla was seeking permits for 500 vehicles. RCC measures predictive value, not sentiment. The noisier claims are centered around 0.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            Prediction markets aggregate beliefs from people who are willing to bet. That leaves out most people. We need ways to pay for information that don't require gambling.
        </p>

        <p>
            RCC is not a full market. It's intentionally narrow and can assign low credit to information that may have actually been quite valuable to certain parties. Low credit doesn't imply the information was useless, it only implies that it did not improve this forecast at the margin.
        </p>

        <p>
            If we want to turn distributed knowledge into something useful, we need to pay people for being right before everyone else catches on. RCC is one way to do that.
